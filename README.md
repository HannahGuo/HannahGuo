# 👋 Hi, I'm Hannah!

Somehow, out of all the pages on GitHub and the rest of the Internet that you could be on at this very moment, you are looking at my profile. Thanks for stopping by!

- 🏫 I'm a full-time SWE @ [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). Prior to that, I graduated from Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo where I completed internships at Figma, Stripe, as well as Notion.
- 🖼️ I like working on well-designed, high-impact, long-lasting projects that I'm passionate about
- 🧩 I like solving hard, thoughtful problems and learning along the way
- 🛠️ I like thinking about good UX and more recently, copywriting

My personal website (which I designed from the ground-up) can be found at [hannahguo.me](https://hannahguo.me/)!
