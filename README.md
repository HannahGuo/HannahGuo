# Hello 🙋🏻

Somehow, out of all the pages on GitHub and the rest of the Internet that you could be on at this very moment, you are looking at my profile. Thanks for stopping by!

- 🏫 I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo studying Software Engineering 
- 🖼️ I like working on well-designed, high impact projects
- 🧩 I like solving hard, thoughtful problems alongside other smart, motivated people
- 🛠️ I think good UX is underrated, and I always work with a user-first approach

My personal website (which I designed from the ground-up) can be found at [https://hannahguo.me/](https://hannahguo.me/)!
