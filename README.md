# Hello 🙋🏻

Somehow, out of all the page on GitHub and the rest of the Intenet you could be on at this very moment, you are looking at my GitHub profile. Thanks for stopping by!

### About Me
I'm an freshman at the University of Waterloo studying Software Engineering, but the sidebar of my profile already says that. Apart from programming, here are some more other neat I like doing.

* 🗺️ **[Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/play)!** There's some beautiful places near me that I never would have otherwise found.
* 📚 **Reading!** Some of my favourites include [I, Robot 🤖](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41804.I_Robot), [The Martian 🥔](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian), and [The Illuminae Files series 📄](https://www.goodreads.com/series/116078-the-illuminae-files). 

To see my code projects, feel free to browse my GitHub profile! My personal website can be found here: https://hannahguo.github.io/ ✌️

### Projects 📌
While working full-time in the summer of 2020, I felt like I was wasting my free time... so I came up with the idea to work on mini project sprints, each only about a week long. The idea is to dabble in different languages/libraries, and to try out new things. 

I'm not sure how long I can keep this up into school, but I think it'll be a fun learning experience!
