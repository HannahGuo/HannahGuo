# Hello 🙋🏻

Somehow, out of all the page on GitHub and the rest of the Internet that you could be on at this very moment, you are looking at my profile. Thanks for stopping by!

### About Me
I'm an freshman at the University of Waterloo studying Software Engineering, but the sidebar of my profile already says that. 

**To see my code projects, feel free to browse my GitHub profile! My personal website can be found [here](https://hannahguo.me/) ✌️!**

Apart from programming, here are some more other neat I like doing.

* 🗺️ [Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/play)! There's some beautiful places near me that I never would have otherwise found.
* 📚 Reading! Some of my favourites include [I, Robot 🤖](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41804.I_Robot), [The Martian 🥔](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian), and [The Illuminae Files series 📄](https://www.goodreads.com/series/116078-the-illuminae-files).
