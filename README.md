# 👋 Hi, I'm Hannah!

Somehow, out of all the pages on GitHub and the rest of the Internet that you could be on at this very moment, you are looking at my profile. Thanks for stopping by!

- 🖼️ I like working on well-designed, high-impact, long-lasting projects that I'm passionate about
- 🧩 I like solving hard, thoughtful problems and learning along the way
- 🛠️ I like thinking about good UX and more recently, copywriting

I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, graduating in 2025. After that, I'll be wandering the world, before returning to [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) as a SWE.

My personal website (which I designed from the ground-up) can be found at [hannahguo.me](https://hannahguo.me/)!
