# Hello 🙋🏻

Somehow, out of all the page on GitHub and the rest of the Internet that you could be on at this very moment, you are looking at my profile. Thanks for stopping by!

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo studying Software Engineering. I love programming, and would one day like to write code that helps/improves the lives of millions. I don't like the idea of my work sitting in a corner of the Internet collecting dust (metaphorically, of course). 

**My personal website can be found [✨here✨](https://hannahguo.me/)!**

I feel like everything technical that needs to be said is there, so feel free to explore there (as well as any other projects on my Github profile).
